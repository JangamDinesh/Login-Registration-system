# Login-Registration-system
Based on FILE HANDLING in C++
The project involves a user registration process by asking username and password. 
Upon successful registration, a user file is created with the credentials. 
If the user does not exist, upon login, an error will be shown. 
If the user has registered before and forgot the password, he can access it back by selecting forgot password option and by entering valid captcha.
